# Project.Approval.website
In this Online Project Approval System project, we will focus mainly on automating the process of project submission. In the sense project topics will be submitted online along 
with doc and approval will be provided online by the head of the department along with suggestions if any. This will reduce the physical efforts of students meeting the head of
the department and also reduce the time frame period of completing this part of project work. Students can also update their project status weekly and provide in for regarding 
the progress, which will be monitored by all relevant professors and head of departments.

Using this web application, the Student can send a request to HOD for Project Title along with Abstract. On acceptance of HOD, he/she can design the Project along with necessary 
documents and submit to the College over the Internet using College’s website. In the HOD Project Review, the HOD can download the Project content from the College’s 
website (from the Internet) and can do the evaluation. As well, the Student can also download the content from the College’s website and give Demo of the Project (by restoring 
the database, configuring the Project site, etc.) to the HOD.
